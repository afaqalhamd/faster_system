# Device Token Functionality Hidden - Summary

## Request
The user requested to hide the device token functionality in the delivery application.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Modified AuthController
- **File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Delivery/AuthController.php`
- **Changes:**
  - Removed `device_token` validation rule from login method
  - Commented out the device token update logic
  - Device token parameter is no longer processed during login

### 2. Updated API Documentation
- **File:** `DELIVERY_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Changes:**
  - Added note that device token functionality is temporarily disabled
  - Updated login request body example to reflect the change
  - Removed device_token field from the example

### 3. Created Documentation
- **File:** `DEVICE_TOKEN_HIDDEN_NOTICE.md`
- **Purpose:** Detailed documentation of the changes made and how to re-enable the functionality

## Current State
- Device token functionality is completely hidden from the delivery login process
- Existing device tokens in the database remain unchanged
- No device tokens will be stored or updated during login
- All other delivery functionality remains intact

## How to Re-enable
To re-enable the device token functionality:

1. Uncomment the validation rule in AuthController:
   ```php
   $validator = Validator::make($request->all(), [
       'email' => 'required|email',
       'password' => 'required|string',
       'device_token' => 'nullable|string'  // Uncomment this line
   ]);
   ```

2. Uncomment the device token update logic:
   ```php
   if ($request->has('device_token')) {
       $user->fc_token = $request->device_token;
       $user->save();
   }
   ```

3. Update the API documentation to reflect the re-enabled functionality

## Impact Assessment
- **Positive:** 
  - Simplifies the login process temporarily
  - Removes dependency on push notification services during testing
- **Negative:**
  - Push notifications will not work until re-enabled
  - Device tracking functionality is temporarily disabled

## Verification
The changes have been implemented and tested to ensure:
- Login still works without device token
- No errors occur when device_token is not provided
- Profile and logout functionality remain unaffected
- All other delivery features continue to work normally
