# Enhanced Tracking Events Display

## Overview
This document explains the enhancements made to the tracking events display to provide a more professional and visually appealing presentation, especially for proof images.

## Design Improvements

### 1. Timeline Structure
- **Vertical Timeline**: Events are displayed in a clear vertical timeline with connecting lines
- **Visual Markers**: Each event has a distinctive circular marker with an icon
- **Connector Lines**: Lines connect events to show chronological progression

### 2. Event Cards
- **Card-Based Layout**: Each event is presented in a clean card with subtle shadows
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift slightly on hover for better interactivity
- **Color Coding**: Left border color indicates the timeline connection
- **Structured Information**: Clear separation of location, date, status, and description

### 3. Proof Image Display
- **Gallery-Style Container**: Images are displayed in a dedicated section with background styling
- **Larger Thumbnails**: Increased maximum size to 200x200 pixels for better visibility
- **Hover Zoom**: Images slightly enlarge on hover with smooth transitions
- **Lightbox Viewer**: Clicking images opens them in a professional lightbox viewer (Fancybox)

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- **Improved Spacing**: Better vertical spacing between events
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with bold headings and muted descriptions
- **Color Scheme**: Consistent use of Bootstrap colors for badges and status indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
