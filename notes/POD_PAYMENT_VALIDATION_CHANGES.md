# POD Payment Validation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds payment validation for the POD (Proof of Delivery) status in the sales system. Before a user can select the POD status, the system now validates that the sale is fully paid.

## Changes Made

### 1. JavaScript Validation (`public/custom/js/sales-status-manager.js`)

Added payment validation logic to prevent users from selecting POD status without full payment:

- **`handleStatusChange` method**: Added validation when user selects POD status
- **`validatePaymentForPOD` method**: New function to check if sale is fully paid
- **`showStatusUpdateModal` method**: Added additional validation before showing the modal
- **`handleSuccessResponse` method**: Updated to refresh page after POD status update

### 2. View Update (`resources/views/sale/invoice/edit.blade.php`)

Added a hidden input field to store the current sale status:

- **`#current_sale_status`**: Hidden input to track current status for JavaScript validation

### 3. Validation Logic

The validation checks if the paid amount is equal to or greater than the grand total, with a small tolerance (0.01) to account for floating-point precision issues.

## How It Works

1. When a user selects "POD" from the status dropdown:
   - JavaScript validates that the sale is fully paid
   - If not fully paid, shows an error message and resets the dropdown
   - If fully paid, allows the status change to proceed

2. Payment validation compares:
   - Grand Total from `.grand_total` input field
   - Paid Amount from `.paid_amount` input field
   - Uses tolerance of 0.01 to handle floating-point comparisons

3. After successful POD status update:
   - Page automatically refreshes to show updated information
   - Hidden current status field is updated

## Testing

### Test Cases Covered:
- Fully paid sales (should allow POD)
- Partially paid sales (should block POD)
- Overpaid sales (should allow POD)
- Edge cases with floating-point precision

### Test Files Created:
- `test-pod-payment-validation.php`: PHP-based validation tests
- `test-pod-js-validation.html`: Interactive JavaScript testing page

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Inventory Issues**: Ensures inventory is only deducted when payment is complete
2. **Improves Data Integrity**: Prevents users from marking unpaid sales as delivered
3. **Better User Experience**: Provides clear error messages when validation fails
4. **Automatic Refresh**: Ensures UI reflects the latest status changes

## Error Handling

- Clear error messages when validation fails
- Automatic dropdown reset to previous status
- Tolerance handling for floating-point comparisons
- Graceful degradation if required fields are missing

## Future Improvements

1. Add server-side validation as a backup
2. Implement real-time payment status updates
3. Add visual indicators for payment status
4. Extend validation to other statuses that require payment
