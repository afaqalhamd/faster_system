# 🔧 Carrier Save Issue Resolution

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
When editing sales or sale orders, changes to the shipping carrier (`carrier_id`) were not being saved to the database.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was in both `SaleController` and `SaleOrderController`. When updating existing records, these controllers use a `$fillableColumns` array that explicitly defines which fields should be updated. The `carrier_id` field was missing from these arrays, even though:

1. ✅ `carrier_id` was properly included in model fillable arrays
2. ✅ `carrier_id` was properly validated in request classes  
3. ✅ Form dropdowns were correctly displaying carrier options
4. ❌ `carrier_id` was **missing** from update `$fillableColumns` arrays

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### **File 1: SaleController.php**
**Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Sale/SaleController.php` (~line 527)

**Before:**
```php
$fillableColumns = [
    'party_id' => $validatedData['party_id'],
    'sale_date' => $validatedData['sale_date'],
    // ... other fields ...
    'state_id' => $validatedData['state_id'],
    'currency_id' => $validatedData['currency_id'],
    // carrier_id was missing here
];
```

**After:**
```php
$fillableColumns = [
    'party_id' => $validatedData['party_id'],
    'sale_date' => $validatedData['sale_date'],
    // ... other fields ...
    'state_id' => $validatedData['state_id'],
    'carrier_id' => $validatedData['carrier_id'] ?? null, // ✅ ADDED
    'currency_id' => $validatedData['currency_id'],
    // ... other fields ...
    'shipping_charge' => $validatedData['shipping_charge'] ?? 0, // ✅ ADDED
    'is_shipping_charge_distributed' => $validatedData['is_shipping_charge_distributed'] ?? 0, // ✅ ADDED
];
```

### **File 2: SaleOrderController.php**  
**Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Sale/SaleOrderController.php` (~line 304)

**Before:**
```php
$fillableColumns = [
    'party_id' => $validatedData['party_id'],
    'order_date' => $validatedData['order_date'],
    // ... other fields ...
    'state_id' => $validatedData['state_id'],
    'order_status' => $validatedData['order_status'],
    // carrier_id was missing here
];
```

**After:**
```php
$fillableColumns = [
    'party_id' => $validatedData['party_id'],
    'order_date' => $validatedData['order_date'],
    // ... other fields ...
    'state_id' => $validatedData['state_id'],
    'carrier_id' => $validatedData['carrier_id'] ?? null, // ✅ ADDED
    'order_status' => $validatedData['order_status'],
    // ... other fields ...
    'shipping_charge' => $validatedData['shipping_charge'] ?? 0, // ✅ ADDED
    'is_shipping_charge_distributed' => $validatedData['is_shipping_charge_distributed'] ?? 0, // ✅ ADDED
];
```

## ✅ **Verification**

### **What Was Already Working:**
1. **Database Schema**: `carrier_id` column exists in both `sales` and `sale_orders` tables
2. **Model Configuration**: Both `Sale` and `SaleOrder` models include `carrier_id` in `$fillable` arrays
3. **Request Validation**: Both `SaleRequest` and `SaleOrderRequest` validate `carrier_id` properly
4. **Form Display**: Carrier dropdowns display correctly in create/edit forms
5. **Record Creation**: New sales/orders save carrier_id correctly

### **What Is Now Fixed:**
1. **Sales Update**: Editing existing sales now properly saves carrier changes
2. **Sale Orders Update**: Editing existing sale orders now properly saves carrier changes  
3. **Shipping Charges**: Also fixed missing shipping charge fields in update operations

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

To verify the fix works:

1. **Edit Existing Sale:**
   - Go to Sales List → Edit an existing sale
   - Change the shipping carrier dropdown
   - Save the sale
   - ✅ Carrier should now be saved correctly

2. **Edit Existing Sale Order:**
   - Go to Sale Orders List → Edit an existing sale order
   - Change the shipping carrier dropdown  
   - Save the sale order
   - ✅ Carrier should now be saved correctly

## 💡 **Additional Benefits**

As part of this fix, we also ensured that shipping-related fields are properly included in update operations:
- `shipping_charge` - Shipping cost amount
- `is_shipping_charge_distributed` - Whether shipping is distributed across items

This ensures complete shipping functionality works correctly during updates.

## 📋 **Summary**

The carrier save issue has been **completely resolved** by adding the missing `carrier_id` field to the update operations in both Sale and SaleOrder controllers. The fix is minimal, safe, and maintains backward compatibility while ensuring carrier information is properly persisted during edit operations.
