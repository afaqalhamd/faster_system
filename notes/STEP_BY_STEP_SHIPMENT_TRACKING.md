## Step 8: View Tracking Data via API

To retrieve tracking data via API, you can use the following endpoints:

### Get a Specific Tracking Record
```bash
GET /api/shipment-tracking/{id}
```

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://your-domain.com/api/shipment-tracking/1" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Get All Tracking Records for a Sale Order
```bash
GET /api/sale-orders/{saleOrderId}/tracking-history
```

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://your-domain.com/api/sale-orders/1/tracking-history" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Step 9: Using the API Response Data

The API responses will include all relevant tracking information:

### Single Tracking Record Response
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "sale_order_id": 1,
    "carrier_id": 1,
    "tracking_number": "DHL1234567890",
    "tracking_url": "https://www.dhl.com/en/express/tracking.html?AWB=1234567890",
    "status": "Out for Delivery",
    "estimated_delivery_date": "2025-10-15",
    "actual_delivery_date": null,
    "notes": "Package loaded on delivery truck - ETA 4:00 PM",
    "created_by": 1,
    "updated_by": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-09-26T10:00:00.000000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-09-26T15:00:00.000000Z",
    "carrier": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "DHL",
      "email": "info@dhl.com",
      // ... other carrier fields
    },
    "tracking_events": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "shipment_tracking_id": 1,
        "event_date": "2025-09-26T14:30:00.000000Z",
        "location": "New York Distribution Center",
        "status": "In Transit",
        "description": "Package sorted for delivery to destination",
        "latitude": "40.71280000",
        "longitude": "-74.00600000",
        // ... other event fields
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Step 10: Handling Multiple Trackings per Sale Order

The system supports multiple tracking records per sale order:

1. Click **"Add Tracking"** multiple times to create several tracking records
2. Each tracking can have different carriers, tracking numbers, and statuses
3. All trackings will be displayed in the tracking section
4. Each tracking can have its own events and documents

Example scenario:
- Tracking #1: DHL for main package
- Tracking #2: UPS for accessory items
- Tracking #3: Local courier for special delivery

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Failed to save tracking" Error
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify you're logged in and have proper permissions
3. Ensure all required fields are filled correctly

### Issue 2: 401 Unauthorized Error When Using API
**Solution**:
1. Ensure you're including the Authorization header with a valid token
2. Check that Sanctum is properly configured
3. Verify the user has appropriate permissions

### Issue 3: Tracking Not Appearing After Creation
**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify the tracking was actually saved in the database

## Best Practices
