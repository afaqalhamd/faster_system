6. User acceptance testing
7. Bug fixing and optimization

#### Deliverables:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimized app
- Security compliant application
- Bug-free release candidate

### Phase 8: Deployment and Documentation (Day 8)

#### Tasks:
1. Prepare app for deployment:
   - Create app icons and splash screens
   - Configure app stores metadata
   - Generate signed APK/AAB for Android
   - Generate IPA for iOS
2. Create user documentation:
   - User manual for delivery personnel
   - Troubleshooting guide
3. Create technical documentation:
   - Developer setup guide
   - API integration documentation
4. Deploy to app stores
5. Set up monitoring and crash reporting

#### Deliverables:
- Published applications on app stores
- Complete user documentation
- Technical documentation
