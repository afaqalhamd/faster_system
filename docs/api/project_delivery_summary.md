## Key Features Implemented in API

### Carrier-Based Approach
The API follows your preferred carrier-based approach, ensuring that:
- Delivery users only see orders assigned to their carrier
- Carrier information is integrated throughout the system
- Business logic alignment with your existing processes

### Role-Based Access Control
- Delivery personnel have appropriate access levels
- Status visibility restrictions implemented as per your preferences
- Edit permissions aligned with user roles

### Core Functionality
1. **Order Management**
   - Listing with pagination and filtering
   - Detailed order information
   - Customer contact integration

2. **Status Management**
   - Delivery-specific status options
   - Proof of Delivery with image capture
   - Status history tracking

3. **Payment Processing**
   - In-app payment collection
   - Balance calculation
   - Payment history

## Data Models

The API provides comprehensive data models including:
- Sale Order information with financial details
- Customer (Party) information with contact details
- Item Transaction details with pricing
- Carrier information
- User profile with carrier assignment

All monetary values are formatted with 2 decimal places for proper currency display.

## Implementation Guidelines

2. Implement role-based status visibility
3. Follow the POD interaction preferences (modal behavior)
4. Ensure proper validation for required fields

## Next Steps

1. **Development Team**: Begin implementation using the provided documentation
2. **Review Process**: Weekly checkpoints to ensure alignment
3. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive testing before deployment
4. **Deployment**: Publish to app stores with proper documentation
5. **Training**: Provide training materials for delivery personnel
