# Waybill Integration Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Waybill Data Not Being Saved
**Problem**: When users entered waybill information in the "Add Tracking" modal, the data was not being saved to the database.

**Root Cause**: The API controller methods (`store` and `update`) in `ShipmentTrackingController` were only extracting specific fields using `$request->only()` but were not including the waybill fields (`waybill_number` and `waybill_type`).

**Fix**: Updated both the `store` and `update` methods in `app/Http/Controllers/Api/ShipmentTrackingController.php` to include waybill fields in the data extraction:

```php
$data = $request->only([
    'tracking_number',
    'tracking_url',
    'status',
    'estimated_delivery_date',
    'notes',
    'waybill_number',
    'waybill_type'
]);
```

### 2. Waybill Information Not Displayed in Tracking List
**Problem**: After saving waybill information, it was not being displayed in the shipment tracking list on the sale order edit page.

**Root Cause**: The Blade template was not including waybill information in the tracking item display.

**Fix**: Updated `resources/views/sale/order/edit.blade.php` to display waybill information in the tracking list:

```html
@if($tracking->waybill_number)
    <span class="badge bg-info ms-2">{{ __('shipment.waybill') }}: {{ $tracking->waybill_number }}</span>
@endif
@if($tracking->waybill_type)
    <span class="badge bg-secondary ms-1">{{ $tracking->waybill_type }}</span>
@endif
```

### 3. Missing Language Translations
**Problem**: Missing translation for the word "Waybill" in different languages.

**Fix**: Added 'waybill' translation key to all language files:
- `lang/en/shipment.php`
- `lang/ar/shipment.php`
- `lang/hi/shipment.php`
